RED VELVET CAKE~
Red velvet cake is a red, red-brown, crimson or scarlet-colored chocolate layer cake, layered with ermine icing.
 Essentially itâ€™s a chocolate cake made with little cocoa powder. The cocoa reacts with the acidic vinegar and buttermilk,
 and in turn keeps the cake moist, light, and fluffy. It also helps to give a maroon colour that is often enhanced by extra food-colouring.
 The chocolate taste is fairly mild but the flavours are delicately rich.
